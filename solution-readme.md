Nice to have, but not added to the solution
* better and nicer looking components (CSS)
* security (auth..)
* nicer separate routes for sales and followup
* constants and/or reading from DB, for configuration (prompts, URLs) related items  
* some unified logging
* use TypeScript
* add unit tests (maybe also integration and/or e2e tests)
